I got married with my man last year and things between us were fine and we were so happy and so much in love and we did everything together as a married couple.We went to dinners and movies together. Then one day as I was cleaning my husband clothes, I found a piece of paper with a phone number on it and love message. My heart skipped for a moment and I knew there and then that my man was cheating on me. I kept quiet and didn't say anything to him, I called Mama lucky and told her my problem because Mama lucky had helped my friend with her boyfriend who was cheating on her too. Mama lucky made a love and binding spiritual prayer for me and in 1 day of the prayers my husband came home early and sat me down and confessed everything about the other woman and told me they had not gone far and his sorry for hurting me and not respecting our marriage and begged for my forgiveness and promised never to hurt me again or see that woman ever again. I forgave my man and he is back to the same man i used to know and he loves me so much now and we do everything as a couple with our daughter. I came back home the next day from work and he had decorated our bedroom with love pillows and candle lights and roses, it was so lovely. Thanks so much Mama lucky your prayers really work. For you all that may be going through the same situation, please don't hesitate to call or whatsapp Mama lucky on +27788823185.",

Say what you want about President Biden and his son. They have not been charged with NOTHING just another Benghazi in my opinion. McCarthy said it all Benghazi outcry was only to pull down Mrs Clinton poll numbers. This Hunter Biden story is an attempt to do the same to President Biden numbers. Republicans has no shame..they  feed off Trumps bs that these are democrats judges and prosecutors going after him or ii is nothing but witch hunt. Remember that last witch hunt. A few witches went to jail.. Now ask yourself with the number of republican judges McConnell put on the bench(300) now add the 3 supreme court justices they still can not find away to bring their claims against President Biden or his son in front of a judge. Why because they have nothing. Unlike with the Trump family who was just hit with 10 felonies. What I really wonder is. How many republicans thought President Obama presidency would end on such a high note? Compared to that of the twice impeached one term former president whos company is now facing 10 felony charges.",

            "comment_text": "What Underlies the G.O.P. Commitment to Ignorance?  By Paul Krugman 6/28/21           As everyone knows, leftists hate America\u2019s military. Recently, a prominent left-wing media figure attacked Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declaring, \u201cHe\u2019s not just a pig, he\u2019s stupid.\u201d  Oh, wait. That was no leftist, that was TF1\u2019s Tucker Carlson. What set Carlson off was testimony in which Milley told a congressional hearing that he considered it important \u201cfor those of us in uniform to be open-minded and widely read.\u201d  The problem is obvious. Closed-mindedness and ignorance have become core conservative values, and those who reject these values are the enemy, no matter what they may have done to serve the country.  The Milley hearing was part of the orchestrated furor over \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d which has dominated right-wing media for the past few months, getting close to 2,000 mentions on Fox so far this year. One often sees assertions that those attacking critical race theory have no idea what it\u2019s about, but I disagree; they understand that it has something to do with assertions that America has a history of racism and of policies that explicitly or implicitly widened racial disparities.  And such assertions are unmistakably true. The Tulsa race massacre really happened, and it was only one of many such incidents. The 1938 underwriting manual for the Federal Housing Administration really did declare that \u201cincompatible racial groups should not be permitted to live in the same communities.\u201d  We can argue about the relevance of this history to current policy, but who would argue against acknowledging simple facts?  The modern right, that\u2019s who. The current obsession with critical race theory is a cynical attempt to change the subject away from the Biden administration\u2019s highly popular policy initiatives, while pandering to the white rage that Republicans deny exists. But it\u2019s only one of multiple subjects on which willful ignorance has become a litmus test for anyone hoping to succeed in Republican politics.  Thus, to be a Republican in good standing one must deny the reality of man-made climate change, or at least oppose any meaningful action to limit greenhouse gas emissions. One must reject or at least express skepticism about the theory of evolution. And don\u2019t even get me started on things like the efficacy of tax cuts.  What underlies this cross-disciplinary commitment to ignorance? On each subject, refusing to acknowledge reality serves special interests. Climate denial caters to the fossil fuel industry; evolution denial caters to religious fundamentalists; tax-cut mysticism caters to billionaire donors.  But there\u2019s also, I\u2019d argue, a spillover effect: Accepting evidence and logic is a sort of universal value, and you can\u2019t take it away in one area of inquiry without degrading it across the board. That is, you can\u2019t declare that honesty about America\u2019s racial history is unacceptable and expect to maintain intellectual standards everywhere else. In the modern right-wing universe of ideas, everything is political; there are no safe subjects.  This politicization of everything inevitably creates huge tension between conservatives and institutions that try to respect reality.  There have been many studies documenting the strong Democratic lean of college professors, which is often treated as prima facie evidence of political bias in hiring. A new law in Florida requires that each state university conduct an annual survey \u201cwhich considers the extent to which competing ideas and perspectives are presented,\u201d which doesn\u2019t specifically mandate the hiring of more Republicans but clearly gestures in that direction.  An obvious counterargument to claims of biased hiring is self-selection: How many conservatives choose to pursue careers in, say, sociology? Is hiring bias the reason police officers seem to have disproportionately supported Donald Trump in the 2016 election, or is this simply a reflection of the kind of people who choose careers in law enforcement?  But beyond that, the modern G.O.P. is no home for people who believe in objectivity. One striking feature of surveys of academic partisanship is the overwhelming Democratic lean in hard sciences like biology and chemistry; but is that really hard to understand when Republicans reject science on so many fronts?  One recent study marvels that even finance departments are mainly Democratic. Indeed, you might expect finance professors, some of whom do lucrative consulting for Wall Street, to be pretty conservative. But even they are repelled by a party committed to zombie economics.  Which brings me back to General Milley. The U.S. military has traditionally leaned Republican, but the modern officer corps is highly educated, open-minded and, dare I say it, even a bit intellectual \u2014 because those are attributes that help win wars.  Unfortunately, they are also attributes the modern G.O.P. finds intolerable.  So something like the attack on Milley was inevitable. Right-wingers have gone all in on ignorance, so they were bound to come into conflict with every institution \u2014 including the U.S. military \u2014 that is trying to cultivate knowledge.",

            "comment_text": "What Underlies the G.O.P. Commitment to Ignorance?  By Paul Krugman 6/28/21           As everyone knows, leftists hate America\u2019s military. Recently, a prominent left-wing media figure attacked Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declaring, \u201cHe\u2019s not just a pig, he\u2019s stupid.\u201d  Oh, wait. That was no leftist, that was TF1\u2019s Tucker Carlson. What set Carlson off was testimony in which Milley told a congressional hearing that he considered it important \u201cfor those of us in uniform to be open-minded and widely read.\u201d  The problem is obvious. Closed-mindedness and ignorance have become core conservative values, and those who reject these values are the enemy, no matter what they may have done to serve the country.  The Milley hearing was part of the orchestrated furor over \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d which has dominated right-wing media for the past few months, getting close to 2,000 mentions on Fox so far this year. One often sees assertions that those attacking critical race theory have no idea what it\u2019s about, but I disagree; they understand that it has something to do with assertions that America has a history of racism and of policies that explicitly or implicitly widened racial disparities.  And such assertions are unmistakably true. The Tulsa race massacre really happened, and it was only one of many such incidents. The 1938 underwriting manual for the Federal Housing Administration really did declare that \u201cincompatible racial groups should not be permitted to live in the same communities.\u201d  We can argue about the relevance of this history to current policy, but who would argue against acknowledging simple facts?  The modern right, that\u2019s who. The current obsession with critical race theory is a cynical attempt to change the subject away from the Biden administration\u2019s highly popular policy initiatives, while pandering to the white rage that Republicans deny exists. But it\u2019s only one of multiple subjects on which willful ignorance has become a litmus test for anyone hoping to succeed in Republican politics.  Thus, to be a Republican in good standing one must deny the reality of man-made climate change, or at least oppose any meaningful action to limit greenhouse gas emissions. One must reject or at least express skepticism about the theory of evolution. And don\u2019t even get me started on things like the efficacy of tax cuts.  What underlies this cross-disciplinary commitment to ignorance? On each subject, refusing to acknowledge reality serves special interests. Climate denial caters to the fossil fuel industry; evolution denial caters to religious fundamentalists; tax-cut mysticism caters to billionaire donors.  But there\u2019s also, I\u2019d argue, a spillover effect: Accepting evidence and logic is a sort of universal value, and you can\u2019t take it away in one area of inquiry without degrading it across the board. That is, you can\u2019t declare that honesty about America\u2019s racial history is unacceptable and expect to maintain intellectual standards everywhere else. In the modern right-wing universe of ideas, everything is political; there are no safe subjects.  This politicization of everything inevitably creates huge tension between conservatives and institutions that try to respect reality.  There have been many studies documenting the strong Democratic lean of college professors, which is often treated as prima facie evidence of political bias in hiring. A new law in Florida requires that each state university conduct an annual survey \u201cwhich considers the extent to which competing ideas and perspectives are presented,\u201d which doesn\u2019t specifically mandate the hiring of more Republicans but clearly gestures in that direction.  An obvious counterargument to claims of biased hiring is self-selection: How many conservatives choose to pursue careers in, say, sociology? Is hiring bias the reason police officers seem to have disproportionately supported Donald Trump in the 2016 election, or is this simply a reflection of the kind of people who choose careers in law enforcement?  But beyond that, the modern G.O.P. is no home for people who believe in objectivity. One striking feature of surveys of academic partisanship is the overwhelming Democratic lean in hard sciences like biology and chemistry; but is that really hard to understand when Republicans reject science on so many fronts?  One recent study marvels that even finance departments are mainly Democratic. Indeed, you might expect finance professors, some of whom do lucrative consulting for Wall Street, to be pretty conservative. But even they are repelled by a party committed to zombie economics.  Which brings me back to General Milley. The U.S. military has traditionally leaned Republican, but the modern officer corps is highly educated, open-minded and, dare I say it, even a bit intellectual \u2014 because those are attributes that help win wars.  Unfortunately, they are also attributes the modern G.O.P. finds intolerable.  So something like the attack on Milley was inevitable. Right-wingers have gone all in on ignorance, so they were bound to come into conflict with every institution \u2014 including the U.S. military \u2014 that is trying to cultivate knowledge.",

They don\u2019t like judges \u2014 even ones they appointed. They do not like book publishers, social media platforms, the mainstream media or Hollywood. They also think universities and tech companies are bad.  They do not like many local voting officials or people who take part in large-turnout elections. They do not like former vice president Mike Pence, former attorney general William P. Barr or many other officials who served in the last administration.  They REALLY do not like immigrants \u2014 even when they are legal. They do not like international organizations (e.g. NATO, the World Health Organization and the International Monetary Fund).  They even don\u2019t like Liz Cheney, Mitt Romney, Richard Burr, Pat Toomey, or even John McCain.   Jennifer Rubin  They DO however apparently adore the former president who just sent the R.N.C. a cease-and-desist letter demanding they stop using his likeness to raise money...

            "comment_text": "Remember when Trump said, \u201cGlobal warming is a hoax.\u201d? Climate Change Batters the West Before Summer Even Begins Global warming has been fueling disasters in the region for years. Now, an early heat wave and severe drought are threatening lives and leaving water in perilously short supply. By Brad Plumer, Jack Healy, Winston Choi-Schagrin and Henry Fountain * \t\tJune 17, 2021 A heat dome is baking Arizona and Nevada, where temperatures have soared past 115 degrees this week and doctors are warning that people can get third-degree burns from the sizzling asphalt.  At Lake Mead, which supplies water for 25 million people in three southwestern states and Mexico, water levels have plunged to their lowest point since the reservoir was filled in the 1930s. In California, farmers are abandoning their thirstiest crops to save others, and communities are debating whether to ration tap water. In Texas, electricity grids are under strain as residents crank their air-conditioners, with utilities begging customers to turn off appliances to help avert blackouts. In Arizona, Montana and Utah, wildfires are blazing. And it\u2019s not even summer yet. \u201cWe\u2019re still a long way out from the peak of the wildfire season and the peak of the dry season,\u201d said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cThings are likely to get worse before they get better.\u201d  Global warming, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, has been heating up and drying out the American West for years. Now the region is broiling under a combination of a drought that is the worst in two decades and a record-breaking heat wave. \u201cThe Southwest is getting hammered by climate change harder than almost any other part of the country, apart from perhaps coastal cities,\u201d said Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan. \u201cAnd as bad as it might seem today, this is about as good as it\u2019s going to get if we don\u2019t get global warming under control.\u201d With temperatures expected to keep rising as nations struggle to rein in their planet-warming emissions, the Western United States will need to take difficult and costly measures to adapt. That includes redesigning cities to endure punishing heat, conserving water, and engineering grids that don\u2019t fail during extreme weather. This month has offered glimpses of whether states and cities are up to that task and has shown they still have far to go.  From Montana to Southern California, much of the West is suffering from unusually high temperatures. Some 50 million Americans face heat-related warnings. Records have been tied or broken in places like Palm Springs, Salt Lake City and Billings, Montana. As 115-degree temperatures cooked Phoenix\u2019s Roosevelt Row Arts District on Tuesday, Timothy Medina, 58, was perched on a black metal platform 12 feet above the sidewalk, finishing the blue lettering of a sign for a coffee shop. \u201cIt\u2019s brutal \u2014 that heat against the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me take a quick swig of water.\u201d  Construction workers, landscapers and outdoor painters like Mr. Medina have few options but to bear the heat. He wore jeans to avoid burning his skin, along with a long sleeve fluorescent yellow shirt and a $2 woven hat. But soon the heat was winning.  \u201cI start feeling out of breath, fatigued,\u201d he said. Extreme heat is the clearest signal of global warming, and the most deadly. Last year heat killed at least 323 people in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, a record by far.  Outdoor workers are particularly at risk, along with older people and anyone without adequate shelter or access to air conditioning. Across the country, heat waves are becoming more frequent, lasting longer and occurring earlier in the year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Severe heat early in the spring can be especially dangerous because it catches people off guard, experts say. Cities like Phoenix are struggling to keep up. While the city runs air-conditioned cooling centers, many were shut down last year amid the pandemic. And ensuring that the centers are accessible to everyone is a challenge. Kayla and Richard Contreras, who sleep in a blue tent on a baking sidewalk in a homeless encampment near downtown Phoenix, said the cooling centers were not an option because they have a dog and they worried about leaving their belongings unattended in their tent. They said they knew 10 homeless people who died in the heat last year. Mr. Contreras, 47, fills water bottles from the spigots of homes he walks by. Ms. Contreras, 56, said she saves food stamps to buy popsicles on the hottest days. \u201cThis is what keeps us alive,\u201d she said, as she handed an orange popsicle to a friend. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in Hell.\u201d Sundown brings no relief. In Las Vegas, where the National Hockey League playoffs are taking place, forecasters expected the mercury to push past 100 degrees when the puck dropped Wednesday evening. Last month, the Phoenix City Council approved $2.8 million in new climate spending, including creating a four-person Office of Heat Response and Mitigation. \u201cThat\u2019s a good start, but we\u2019re clearly not doing enough yet,\u201d said David Hondula, an Arizona State University scientist who studies heat\u2019s consequences. Drastically reducing heat deaths would require adding trees and shade in underserved neighborhoods and increasing funding to help residents who need help with energy bills or who lack air conditioning, among other things, he said. https://sustainabilityx.co/once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-president-that-didnt-believe-in-climate-change-21414c69e829?gi=471ca99d3263 ",
